Getting started with the AcademicPage template on GitHub to create your personal academic website involves several steps. Here's a guide to help you through the process:

### Step 1: Fork the AcademicPage Repository
1. **Navigate to the AcademicPage repository on GitHub**: Go to the repository page, typically `https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io`.
2. **Fork the repository**: Click on the "Fork" button on the top right of the repository page to create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

### Step 2: Rename the Repository
1. **Rename your forked repository**: Go to your GitHub repositories and find the newly forked `academicpages.github.io`. Click on "Settings" and change the repository name to `[your-username].github.io`. This is important because GitHub will use this naming convention to serve your website at `https://[your-username].github.io`.

### Step 3: Clone the Repository Locally
1. **Clone the repository to your local machine**: Open your terminal and run the following command:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/[your-username].github.io
   ```
2. **Navigate into the repository directory**:
   ```sh
   cd [your-username].github.io
   ```

### Step 4: Install Jekyll and Dependencies
1. **Install Ruby**: Ensure you have Ruby installed on your machine. You can check by running:
   ```sh
   ruby -v
   ```
   If it's not installed, download and install it from [ruby-lang.org](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/).

2. **Install Jekyll and Bundler**:
   ```sh
   gem install jekyll bundler
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**: Navigate to your cloned repository directory and run:
   ```sh
   bundle install
   ```

### Step 5: Customize Your Site
1. **Configure the site**: Open `_config.yml` in your repository's root directory and customize it with your personal information. Update fields like `title`, `email`, `description`, and `author`.

2. **Add your content**: Customize the existing pages and add new ones as needed. The main content files are located in `_pages`, `_posts`, and `_publications`.

3. **Run Jekyll locally**: To see your changes live as you edit, run:
   ```sh
   bundle exec jekyll serve
   ```
   This will build your site and serve it locally at `http://localhost:4000`.

### Step 6: Push Changes to GitHub
1. **Commit your changes**:
   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial customization"
   ```
2. **Push your changes to GitHub**:
   ```sh
   git push origin main
   ```

### Step 7: Enable GitHub Pages
1. **Configure GitHub Pages**: Go to the settings of your repository on GitHub. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
2. **Select the source**: From the dropdown menu, select the branch you want to use (typically `main`).

### Step 8: Access Your Site
- **Visit your site**: Go to `https://[your-username].github.io` to see your personal academic website live.

### Additional Customizations
- **Add publications**: Use the `_publications` folder to add your publications in the proper format.
- **Add posts**: Use the `_posts` folder for your blog posts or news updates.
- **Customize layout and style**: Modify the `_layouts`, `_includes`, and `_sass` directories to change the look and feel of your site.

By following these steps, you should have a fully functional personal academic website up and running using the AcademicPage template on GitHub.
