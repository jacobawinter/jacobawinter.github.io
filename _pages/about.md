Welcome!

I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Political Science at the University of Toronto. I study the political economy of development, examining how access to markets, resource rents, and political leverage leads politicians pursue different policy agendas. My research is forthcoming in *Political Science Research and Methods*.

At UofT, I've been affiliated with the [Global Economic Policy Lab](https://munkschool.utoronto.ca/gepl/people) at the Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy and the [International Centre for Tax and Development](https://logri.org/project/potential-models-for-linking-revenues-with-public-services-in-lilongwe-mzuzu-zomba-and-blantyre-city-councils/). In the past, I worked with several nonprofits to help them effectively learn from their data. For more, check out my [CV](/files/CV_WinterJ_2024.09.pdf)
