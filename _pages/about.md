I am a PhD Candidate in Political Science at the University of Toronto. My research focuses on how leaders allocate their attention across policy problems. My dissertation project explores the impact of of external finance and electoral pressures on political speech and budget allocations in sub-Saharan Africa. My work has been published in [Political Science Research & Methods](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-science-research-and-methods/article/reassessing-world-bank-conditionality-beyond-count-measures/EEACAD72D4C0D886C51B0005EA5E7C3C){:target="_blank"}.
